Oh, this is just for practise, getting to know Scala.
I't a simple pocket calculator, which can add, substract, multiply and divice some values and will (almost) behave
like a real pocket calculator... Buttons are beeing deactivated when not needed (eg a point, when a point is already 
in the enter field). I intendet to add braces, however this is not working yet.
